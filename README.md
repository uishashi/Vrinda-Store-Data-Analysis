Vrinda Store Data Analysis – Excel Project Summary

Hi everyone! I’m excited to share my Excel project — Vrinda Store Data Analysis.
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of an online fashion store using Excel. The dataset includes customer details,
order information, delivery status, product categories, and sales channels.

Here’s what I did in this project:

Cleaned and formatted raw data using Excel tools like Text-to-Columns, Remove Duplicates, and Filters.
Added a new column for Age Group and categorized customers into Teenagers, Adults, and Seniors.
Used Pivot Tables to summarize sales by gender, state, month, and sales channel.
Created interactive dashboards with charts and slicers for better visualization.
Analyzed key metrics such as total sales, total orders, average order value, and top-performing categories.

Designed a monthly trend chart to understand seasonality and customer behavior.

Highlighted insights like:

  Women shoppers contributed the highest sales.

  Myntra and Amazon were the top-performing platforms.

  Most orders came from Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.

  The Adult age group made the majority of purchases.

Finally, I built a dynamic Excel dashboard to present all the findings clearly.
This project helped me strengthen my Excel skills, especially in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and taught me how to turn raw data into meaningful business insights.
